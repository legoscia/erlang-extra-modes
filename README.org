* Extra Erlang modes

This repository contains Emacs modes for various Erlang-related file
formats.

If you're using Emacs 25 or newer, you can install all the modules in
one go by invoking M-x package-install-file on the current *directory*.

** archive-escript-zip

This module lets you open escript files that consist of a zip archive
with a prepended header.  Such files open in archive-mode, and you can
open the individual files within the archive.

** beam-file-mode

This module attempts to display some useful information about beam
files, including a rendering of the "abstract code" chunk into Erlang
if present.

** erlang-boot

Erlang "boot" files are just an Erlang term encoded in the external
term format.  Let's display the decoded term instead of binary data.
